[Russian version](README.ru.md)

List of my projets written on c# using Unity game engine.

## Finished

First of all, here is the list of games written for different game jams:

- [Another door](https://auteam.itch.io/another-door) - puzzle game about doors between different dimentions. This is a submission for [Brackeys Game Jam 2024.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-11/rate/2534655) where it took 3 place (out of 787) in overall rating and 1 place in "innovations" category. The game features advanced graphicks programming technique which might have been a reason for such high rating.

- [Strange dataset](https://auteam.itch.io/strange-dataset) - puzzle, in which player will try working as a neural network and sort images based on descriptions. 
the difficulty is that the descriptions are given in an unknown language and have to be deciphered. This game is built for [wowie game jam 4](https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-4) and took 8 place (out of 1015) for creativity. Source files can be found [here](https://github.com/hevezolly/ImageRecognitionWowie)

- [OffLight](https://auteam.itch.io/offlight) - game, where you have to bring group of people to the light. Litterally, couse if person steps into the darkness - he dies.

- [Seconds to death](https://auteam.itch.io/seconds-to-death) - reanimator simulator. Objective is to controll both doctor's hands to defibrillate successfuly.
Try not to tungle up your arms!

- [Let there be NO chaos](https://auteam.itch.io/let-there-be-no-chaos) - game, where you should place appearing objects in a correct on the surface of a planet.
The game is fully 2d, but rotation and 3d appearence of a sphere implemented with shader.

- [Cursed Graveyard](https://auteam.itch.io/cursed-graveyard) - Unfortunatley we didn't have time to implement a tutorial at the course of a game jam. 
Goal of the game is to bury coffins and getting money for it. For those money you can by different tombstones. If the deceased doesn't like his tombstone, 
he could rise and start creating troubles.
